# Pitch detection with FFT

## User Guide
Use Flask UI in the browser to run the program. Project and the dependencies are managed with Poetry, so the libraries should be easy to install in the project root with:
```
poetry install
```

To open the UI in the browser, go to project src folder and type: 
```
poetry run python app.py
```

Features:
- choose the test signal and submit
- plot the test signal in time-domain or frequency-domain
- detect the pitch from the test signal (Hz or note) - correct values are described in the UI

More instructions are available in the program UI and detailed implementation in the [Implementation document](https://github.com/KooEeVee/signal-processing/blob/main/documentation/implementation.md).
