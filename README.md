# Pitch detection with FFT

## Peer Review 1
Check the src/app.py for code documentation and instructions how to test the program. If you choose to try to run it, go to src: poetry run python app.py
Features:
- test the pitch detection with synthetic signals
- plot and listen the test signals - play_sound is commented off by default
- compare the pitch detection results achieved with numpy fft functions and fft algorithm
- change the test signals' pitch and see how it shows in the results
- add or reduce noise in the test signals to see how it interferes with the pitch detection
