## What did I do this week
- Research DFT and FFT (6h)
- Programming and manual testing (2 hours)
- Weekly report (0,25 hours)

## What did I learn this week
This week I spent most of my studying time watching videos and reading about DFT and FFT. I learned about polynomial representations, primitive roots of unity, cosine and sine on the complex plane, complex exponentials, Euler's formula, Hermitian symmetry and how to compute the magnitude and phase from the FFT output.

## Program development
I also spent time to learn about the FFT implementation. Now I have a first version of the FFT algorithm and it works with a short test signal. But it needs more testing, and seems a little slow.

## What will I do next
- Finish the FFT algorithm
- Collecting test data
- Start systematic and automatic testing
- Start coding the UI

## Questions and challenges
-
