## What did I do this week
- Poetry setup (1,5 hours)
- Pytest and coverage setup (1 hour)
- Programming and manual testing (5 hours)
- Weekly report (0,5 hours)

## What did I learn this week
Refreshing my memory on:
- Poetry and testing
- Python libraries for sound recording and playback
- Numpy and Matplotlib.pyplot libraries
- FFT functions in Numpy

## Program development
I decided to start the program development by building the application first with python libraries and numpy arrays. That way, I now have a solution that works with test signals and I can use it as a benchmark.

## What will I do next
- Researching sources for FFT implementation
- Collecting test data
- Start coding the FFT algorithm

## Questions and challenges
- The next step is to basically implement the fft module's fundamental_frequency(sound, fs) function without the libraries and numpy arrays?
