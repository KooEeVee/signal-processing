## What did I do this week
- Programming and manual testing (10 hours)
- Weekly report (0,25 hours)

## What did I learn this week
I documented the code to understand the algorithms better. I still need to document the implementation more detailed and related to the math behind it.

## Program development
This week I finished the FFT algorithm and programmed a function to find the fundamental frequency from the FFT output. I added librosa library to convert frequencies to notes and notes to frequencies. All the basic parts of the code should now be ready to start defining and coding the UI.

## What will I do next
- Collecting test data (audio files)
- Start systematic and automatic testing
- Start coding the UI
- Create more documentation

## Questions and challenges
-
